In FeatureReader - "Max Features to Read" is only communicated to the reader when "Feature Types to Read" is not set.

It looks like there is some mechanism to communicate "Max Features to Read" using setConstraints but the [documentation][safe-docs-set-constraints] states regarding `fme_search_type` `fme_specified_feature_range`:
